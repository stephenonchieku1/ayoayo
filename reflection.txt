Initial Reflection:
When I first approached the Ayoayo game implementation, I focused on understanding the core mechanics and rules. The game's structure reminded me of other Mancala-style games, but with its own unique rules. My initial plan was to:

1. Create a Player class to manage each player's state (pits and store)
2. Implement the Ayoayo class with the required methods
3. Focus on the core game mechanics first, then add the special rules
4. Ensure proper state management and validation

The most challenging aspects I anticipated were:
- Implementing the counter-clockwise movement of seeds
- Handling the special rules correctly
- Managing the game state transitions
- Ensuring proper validation of moves

Final Reflection:
The implementation process went through several iterations to get the game logic correct. Here are the key points and challenges encountered:

1. Game State Management:
   - Initially, I struggled with tracking the last pit and player during seed distribution
   - The solution was to maintain separate variables for the current and last positions
   - This made it easier to implement both special rules correctly

2. Special Rules Implementation:
   - The first special rule (extra turn when last seed lands in store) required careful tracking of the last move
   - The second special rule (capturing opponent's seeds) needed precise calculation of opposite pits
   - Testing edge cases was crucial to ensure both rules worked correctly

3. Code Organization:
   - The Player class was kept simple, focusing on state management
   - The Ayoayo class handles all game logic and rules
   - Methods were designed to be clear and focused on single responsibilities

4. Key Takeaways:
   - Careful state tracking is essential for complex board games
   - Testing edge cases early helps prevent bugs
   - Clear method organization makes the code more maintainable
   - The implementation successfully handles all game rules while maintaining clean code structure

The final implementation meets all requirements and handles the game rules correctly, including both special rules and game ending conditions. The code is well-organized and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between the Player and Ayoayo classes.
